      He is due to finish treatment 18th Feb 2013, which we are all looking forward to.  Kavahn was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in October 2009, when he was six. Kavahn is attending Colwill Primary School in Massey and is in Year Four.  He is excelling in all subjects, with the exception of handwriting - which is, I think, just a boy thing. He enjoys being at school and hanging with his friends. He enjoys riding his scooter and is will start his new season of T-Ball shortly, which is his favourite sport.  Kavahn likes to watch rugby and go fishing with his dad.  We have not had a smooth run, but as always has trooped on and got on with his treatment plan.  Kavahn has approximately 1,200 beads of courage®.
